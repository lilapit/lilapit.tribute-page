          <h3>Here's a time line of Vera Rubin's life:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><b>1928</b> Vera Cooper was born on July 23, 1928, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. </li>
            <li><b>1938</b> Her family moved to Washington, D.C., where 10-year-old Vera developed an interest in astronomy while watching the stars from her window. She built a crude telescope out of cardboard with her father, and began to observe and track meteors.</li>
            <li><b>1944</b> She graduated from Coolidge Senior High School</li>
            <li><b>1948</b> She graduated Phi Beta Kappa and earned her bachelor's degree in astronomy in 1948, the only graduate in astronomy that year. She attempted to enroll in a graduate program at Princeton, but was barred due to her gender</li>
            <li><b>1951</b> Rubin  earned a master's degree  from Cornell University. During her graduate studies, she studied the motions of 109 galaxies and made one of the first observations of deviations from Hubble flow (how the galaxies move apart from one another).</li>
            <li><b>1954</b> Her dissertation, concluded that galaxies clumped together, rather than being randomly distributed through the universe, a controversial idea not pursued by others for two decades. Throughout her graduate studies, she encountered discouraging sexism; in one incident she was not allowed to meet with her advisor in his office, because women were not allowed in that area of the Catholic university.</li>
            <li><b>1955-1965</b> she worked at Georgetown University as a research associate astronomer, lecturer (1959–1962), and finally, assistant professor of astronomy (1962–1965).</li>
            <li><b>1963</b> Rubin began a year-long collaboration with Geoffrey and Margaret Burbidge, during which she made her first observations of the rotation of galaxies while using the McDonald Observatory's 82-inch telescope.</li>
            <li><b>1965</b> During her work at the Carnegie Institute, Rubin applied to observe at the Palomar Observatory, despite the fact that the building did not have facilities for women. She created her own women's restroom, sidestepping the lack of facilities available for her. She became the first female astronomer to observe there. Rubin began to study the rotation and outer reaches of galaxies, an interest sparked by her collaboration with the Burbidges. She investigated the rotation curves of spiral galaxies, again beginning with Andromeda, by looking at their outermost material. She observed flat rotation curves: the outermost components of the galaxy were moving as quickly as those close to the center. This was an early indication that spiral galaxies were surrounded by dark matter haloes.  She further uncovered the discrepancy between the predicted angular motion of galaxies based on the visible light and the observed motion. Her research showed that spiral galaxies rotate quickly enough that they should fly apart, if the gravity of their constituent stars was all that was holding them together; because they stay intact, a large amount of unseen mass must be holding them together, a conundrum that became known as the galaxy rotation problem.
Rubin's calculations showed that galaxies must contain at least five to ten times as much dark matter as ordinary matter. Rubin's results were confirmed over subsequent decades, and became the first persuasive results supporting the theory of dark matter, initially proposed by Fritz Zwicky in the 1930s.This data was confirmed by radio astronomers, the discovery of the cosmic microwave background, and images of gravitational lensing. Her research also prompted a theory of non-Newtonian gravity on galactic scales, but this theory has not been widely accepted by astrophysicists.</li>
                <li><b>1991</b> She and her research were discussed in PBS series, The Astronomers.</li>
                <li><b>1996</b> Rubin's perspective on the history of the work on galaxy movements was presented in the lecture she gave upon receiving the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society, the second woman to be so honored, 168 years after Caroline Herschel received the Medal in 1828.</li>
                <li><b>2002</b> Discover magazine recognized Rubin as one of the 50 most important women in science.</li>
                <li><b>2016</b> Rubin died on the night of December 25, 2016, of complications associated with dementia.</li>
                <li><b>2019</b> On December 20, 2019, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope was renamed the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in recognition of Rubin's contributions to the study of dark matter and her outspoken advocacy for the equal treatment and representation of women in science. The observatory will be on a mountain in Cerro Pachón, Chile and focus on the study of dark matter and dark energy.</li>
                <li><b>2020</b> On 6 November 2020, a satellite named after her (ÑuSat 18 or "Vera", COSPAR 2020-079K) was launched into space.</li>
                <li><b>2025</b> Rubin will be honored on a U.S. quarter in 2025 as part of the final year of the American Women quarters program.</li>
                


          </ul>
          <p><em>  Rubin never won the Nobel Prize, though physicists such as Lisa Randall and Emily Levesque have argued that this was an oversight. She was described by Sandra Faber and Neta Bahcall as one of the astronomers who paved the way for other women in the field, as a "guiding light" for those who wished to have families and careers in astronomy.The president of the Carnegie Institution, where she performed the bulk of her work and research, called her a "national treasure".</em></p>
